    <h1><u>Test Formatting</u></h1>
    <p>There are three main types of test formatting. Those are: <b>Bold</b>, <i>Italics</i>, and <u>Underline</u>.</p>

    <h2><u>Inline vs. Block Elements</u></h2>
    <p>A <b>block element</b> moves the content to a new line. The paragraph and header elements are block elements. An <b>Inline element</b> does not display its content to a new line. It keeps the content on the same line as the previous content. Bold, italics, and underline are all inline elements.</p>

    <h3><u>Block Element Examples</u></h3>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p><p>This is a paragraph on the same line in the code as the previous paragraph, but it still moves to he next line.</p>
    <p>This is an example of a nested block element.<p>This is the nested block.</p></p>

    <h3><u>Inline Element Examples</u></h3>
    <p>This is a paragraph with <b>bold</b>. <b>This</b> <i>is</i> <u>a bunch of</u> <b>inline</b> <i>elements.</i></p>

    <h2>Vertical Text Spacing</h2>
    <p>There are two elements that help with vertical spacing between block elements. A <b>line break</b> element adds an empty line and moves the content down to a new line. Its similar to the <kbd>ENTER</kbd> key in a Google/Word doc. A <b>horizontal rule</b> is a line break with a horizontal bar across the page. Both of these are block elements</p>
    <p>Below this paragraph is a line break.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Above this paragraph is a line break.</p>
    <p>Below this paragraph is a horizontal rule.</p>
