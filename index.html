    <h1><u>Test Formatting</u></h1>
    <p>There are two main types of test formatting. Those are: <b>Bold</b>, <i>Italics</i>, and <u>Underline</u>.</p>

    <h3><u>Inline vs. Block</u></h3>
    <p>An <b>Inline element</b> does not move the content to a new line. It keeps tje content on the same line as the previous content. A <b>block</b> element moves the content to a new line. The program element is a block element and tne formatting styles are inline elements.</p>
    <h3><u>Block Example</u></h3>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p><p>This is another paragraph. It makes a new block.</p>
    <p>This is an example of a nested block element.</p><p>This is the nexted block.</p>
    <p>This is a paragraph with <b>bold</b>.</p><b>This</b><i>is</i><u>a bunch of</u><b>inline</b><i>elements.</i>

    <h2>Vertical Text Spacing</h2>
    <p>There are two elements that help with vertical spacing between block elements. A line break moves the content down to a new line. Its similar to the enter key in a word document. A horizontal rule, is a line break with a horizontal bar across the page. Both are block elements</p>
    <p>Below this paragraph is a line break.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Above this paragraph is a line break.</p>
    <p>Below this paragraph is a horizontal rule.</p>
