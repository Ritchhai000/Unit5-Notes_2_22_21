    <h1 style="color: #ffd369"><u>Test Formatting</u></h1>
    <p>There are three main types of test formatting. Those are: <b>Bold</b>, <i>Italics</i>, and <u>Underline</u>.</p>

    <h2><u>Inline vs. Block Elements</u></h2>
    <p>A <b>block element</b> moves the content to a new line. The paragraph and header elements are block elements. An <b>Inline element</b> does not display its content to a new line. It keeps the content on the same line as the previous content. Bold, italics, and underline are all inline elements.</p>

    <h3><u>Block Element Examples</u></h3>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p><p>This is a paragraph on the same line in the code as the previous paragraph, but it still moves to he next line.</p>
    <p>This is an example of a nested block element.<p>This is the nested block.</p></p>

    <h3><u>Inline Element Examples</u></h3>
    <p>This is a paragraph with <b>bold</b>. <b>This</b> <i>is</i> <u>a bunch of</u> <b>inline</b> <i>elements.</i></p>

    <h2>Vertical Text Spacing</h2>
    <p>There are two elements that help with vertical spacing between block elements. A <b>line break</b> element adds an empty line and moves the content down to a new line. Its similar to the <kbd>ENTER</kbd> key in a Google/Word doc. A <b>horizontal rule</b> is a line break with a horizontal bar across the page. Both of these are block elements</p>
    <p>Below this paragraph is a line break.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Above this paragraph is a line break.</p>
    <p>Below this paragraph is a horizontal rule.</p>

    <h1 style="color: #ffd369">Attributes</h1>
    <p><b>Attributes</b> are properties which can change an HTML element. Attriutes are written in the opening tag of ANY html element. The most common attributes are <i>src</i>, <i>href</i>, <i>class</i>, <i>id</i>, and <i>style</i>.</p>

    <h2>Inline CSS Styles</h2>
    <p>The <i>style</i> attribute allows you to add CSS styles to any HTML element.</p>

    <p style="color: mediumpurple">This paragraph has inline CSS style which changes the font color to purple.</p>

    <p style="background-color: lightsteelblue">This paragraph has inline CSS style which changes the background color.</p>

    <p style="color: deepskyblue; background-color: midnightblue">This paragraph has inline CSS style which changes the font color <b>AND</b> the background color.</p>

    <p style="font-family: Jokerman">This paragraph has a different font type.</p>

    <p style="font-size: 24px">This paragraph has a larger font size.</p>

    <p style="background-color: #393e46; color: #ffd369; font-family: Impact; font-size: 72px">This paragraph has all 4 inline styles.</p>

    <h1 style="color:#ffd369">Images</h1>
    <p>An <b>image element</b> is an <i>inline</i> element which inserts pictures into the document. An image element is self-0closing, which means it does not have a closing tag. It has one major attribute, src, which is a filepath that points to the images' location. Those filepaths can either be <b>absolute</b> or <b>relative</b>.</p>

    <h2>Simple Image Example</h2>

    <h2>Image Attributes</h2>
    <p>There are four attributes commonly used for images. <i>Width</i> and <i>height</i> are used to resize the images. <i>Alt</i> allows us to use text description of images for accessibility and broken images. <i>Title</i> allows a hover-over text to appear.</p>

    <h3>Width and Height</h3>
    <p>The width and height can be measured in many different ways, but more common ones are pixels and percentages. Using pixels, you set the specific, precise size based on the pixels. Using percentages, you set the dimensions based on a percentage of the entire page. In either case, setting the width alone respects aspect ratio, while setting both does not.</p>

    <h3>Alt Attribute</h3>
    <p>EVERY picture should at least have the alt attribute. The alt attribute helps with screen readers for visually impaired and in the cases that the image is broken.</p>
